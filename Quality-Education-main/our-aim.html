        pre-primary education so that they are ready for primary education.<br></p>
        <p class="means">What it means:<br></p>
        <p class="desc">The provision of at least one year of free and compulsory quality pre-primary education is
        encouraged, to be delivered by well-trained educators, as well as that of early childhood
        development and care.<br></p>
        <br>
        <p class="headlines"><b>3.  Equal access to technical/ vocational and higher education<br></b></p>
        <p class="unstats">By 2030, ensure equal access for all women and men to affordable and quality technical, vocational
        and tertiaryÂ education, including university<br></p>
        <p class="means">What it means:<br></p>
        <p class="desc">It is imperative to reduce barriers to skills development and technical and vocational education
        and training (TVET), starting from the secondary level, as well as to tertiary education, including
        university, and to provide lifelong learning opportunities for youth and adults. The provision of
        tertiary education should be made progressively free, in line with existing international
        agreements.<br></p>
        <br>
        <p class="headlines"><b>4.  Relevant skills for decent work<br></b></p>
        <p class="unstats">By 2030, substantially increase the number of youth and adults who have relevant skills, including
        technical and vocational skills, for employment, decent jobs and entrepreneurship.<br></p>
        <p class="means">What it means:<br></p>
        <p class="desc">Access: Equitable access to TVET needs to be expanded while quality is ensured. Learning
        opportunities should be increased and diversified, using a wide range of education and training
        modalities.<br>
        Skills acquisition: Beyond work-specific skills, emphasis must be placed on developing high-level
        cognitive and non-cognitive/transferable skills, such as problem solving, critical thinking,
        creativity, teamwork, communication skills and conflict resolution.<br></p>
        <br>
        <p class="headlines"><b>5.  Gender equality and inclusion<br></b></p>
        <p class="unstats">By 2030, eliminate gender disparities in education and ensure equal access to all levels of education
        and vocational training for the vulnerable, including persons with disabilities, indigenous peoples
        and children in vulnerable situations.<br></p>
        <p class="means">What it means:<br></p>
        <p class="desc">Inclusion and equity: All people, irrespective of sex, age, race, colour, ethnicity, language,
        religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property or birth, as well as persons
        with disabilities, migrants, indigenous peoples, and children and youth, especially those in
        vulnerable situations or other status, should have access to inclusive, equitable quality education
        and lifelong learning opportunities.<br>
        Gender equality: All girls and boys, women and men, should have equal opportunity to enjoy
        education of high quality, achieve at equal levels and enjoy equal benefits from education.
        Adolescent girls and young women, who may be subject to gender-based violence, child marriage,
        early pregnancy and a heavy load of household chores, as well as those living in poor and remote
        rural areas, require special attention. In contexts in which boys are disadvantaged, targeted
        action should be taken for them. Policies aimed at overcoming gender inequality are more
        effective when they are part of an overall package that also promotes health, justice, good
        governance and freedom from child labour.<br></p>

        literacy and numeracy.<br></p>

        <p class="desc">Action for this target aims at ensuring that by 2030, all young people and adults across the world
        should have achieved relevant and recognized proficiency levels in functional literacy and

        development, including, among others, through education for sustainable development and
        sustainable lifestyles, human rights, gender equality, promotion of a culture of peace and non-
        violence, global citizenship and appreciation of cultural diversity and of culture&apos;s contribution to
        sustainable development.<br></p>

        informed decisions and assume active roles locally and globally in facing and resolving global
        challenges can be acquired through education for sustainable development and global citizenship
        education, which includes peace and human rights education, as well as intercultural education
